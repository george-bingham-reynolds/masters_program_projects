This repo contains the coding assignments for the course Algorithms for Data Science from the Fall 2020 semester from my Master's in Data Science program at Columbia University. The HW1 folder contains the first coding assignment from the class, related to converting a text file to a graph, defining a search algorithm and finding all connected components. HW2 is related to several different algorithms including workload optimization, a custom algorithm similar to Dykstra, finding common substrings and a variation on the knapsack problem. Lastly, HW3 is about using graphs for flow-related problems.
