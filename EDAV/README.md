This repo contains coding projects from the course Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (EDAV) from the Spring 2021 semester of my Master's in Data Science program at Columbia University. 

In the final project repo you can find a link to the original project (it was a collaboration hosted on another github); it is a full EDAV report on the state of New York City and State environmental policy. In the two homework repos you can find the original R Markdown and HTML code files. The rendered assignments are linked below (the first corresponding to the first assignment, the second to the second). Prompts for the individual problems can be found within the rendered assignments.
